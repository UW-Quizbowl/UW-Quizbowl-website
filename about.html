<h2> What is Quizbowl? </h2>
<p> Quizbowl is a team activity where students from different universities compete against each other on questions spanning a wide range of academic and pop culture disciplines. Questions are broken up into two general types: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Tossups: A question is read and each player attempt to buzz in with the correct answer before the opposing team can. Clues on each question start out hard and get easier as they go, allowing teams with specific knowledge to buzz earlier. </li>
  <li> Bonuses: A team that correctly answers a tossup gets a bonus question. A bonus is given as three short questions that share a topic. </li>
</ul>
<p> Each round consists of 20 tossup questions and the bonus questions awarded to each team. </p>
